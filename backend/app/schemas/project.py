Project Schemas
===============

Pydantic models for project data validation (create, update, responses).

Schema pattern:
- Base: Common fields shared across operations
- Create: Fields required for creation (inherits Base)
- Update: All fields optional for partial updates
- Response: Fields returned in API responses
